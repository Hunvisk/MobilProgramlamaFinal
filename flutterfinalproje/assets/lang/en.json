Let's start the stories of the Galata Tower, which adds a mysterious atmosphere to the Istanbul skyline, with an example from ƒ∞hsan Oktay Anar's book Misty Continents Atlas. In the book, it is told that the white gull guided the Genoese sailors who came to Istanbul for the first time in the dark. The Genoese, who identify the seagull with Jesus Christ as a manifestation of their beliefs, catch it, cook it and eat it after following it to its nest. They built the Galata Tower in his memory in the place where his nest was located.",

    "blogs_text": "One of the most important architectural features of the mosque is the use of the Baroque architectural style, which we encountered especially in the palaces of France and Italy after the 18th century. As a feature of this architectural style, the exterior of the mosque attracts attention with its carved and relief decorations made of magnificently beautiful stones. As is the general characteristic of 19th century mosques, in addition to the main worship section, the mosque also has a sultan's pavilion section built for the sultans to pray and rest. The mosque has large and high windows. The interior walls of the mosque are made of pink plaster with red and white bright stripes, and the marble structure of the pulpit is decorated with pink stones.",
    "blogs_text1": "Sarƒ±yer is one of the distinguished districts located in the north of Istanbul. Alongside serene green areas such as Belgrad Forest and Atat√ºrk Arboretum, it is also home to tourist centers like Emirgan Grove and Rumeli Hisarƒ±, making it one of Istanbul's favorite districts. Sarƒ±yer also appeals to gourmets with its places for breakfast and dining, making it a green district that should be explored in every aspect.",
    "blogs_text2": "You have arrived at the Emin√∂n√º ferry pier or the Emin√∂n√º tram stop. When you turn your back to the sea and look across, you will see a crowded square. This is your entry point to Emin√∂n√º. Emin√∂n√º Square is a place where you could almost throw a needle at any time of the day and it wouldn't fall to the ground. In other words, it's like a summary of Istanbul.",
